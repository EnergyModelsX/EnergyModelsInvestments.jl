# [Examples](@id man-exampl)

`EnergyModelsInvestments` does not provide directly examples as it requires an energy model for running the code.
It is in itself not a model.e
The incorporation of `EnergyModelsInvestments` is explained on the page on *[How to use `EnergyModelsInvestments`](@ref how_to-use_emi)*.
A potential application can be seen in [`EnergyModelsBase`](https://energymodelsx.github.io/EnergyModelsBase.jl/stable/) and [`EnergyModelsGeography`](https://energymodelsx.github.io/EnergyModelsGeography.jl/stable/) in which the previous examples from `EnergyModelsInvestments` are moved.
