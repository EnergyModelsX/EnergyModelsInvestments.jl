    discount_mult_avg(start_year, discount_rate, duration_years)
Calculate average discount for the time period
This is a limit case n->infinity of dividing the time period into n pieces and discounting each separately

``1 / (t_1 - t_0) * \\int_{t=t_0}^{t_1} (1 + r)^{-t} dt``

The advantage of this way of calculating the discount rate is that the discounting does not change if we divide the period in two
